 * "Put your agent to work" (#earn-landing): the page for someone who has just
 * arrived to earn. It stands on its own, with no site header, agents bar or
 * footer, and it looks like the home page's own hero (EarnHero). It fills the screen and scrolls like any other page when the window is short.
 * The $5 welcome is a toast that appears over it (EarnWelcomeToast), not part of the page.
