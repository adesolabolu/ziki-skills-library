/**
 * /superadmin is for site staff only: site roles, every organisation on the
 * site, and platform points. Everything an organization's owners and admins
 * manage lives in /org.
 *
 * Admin pages have loading skeletons (#291), which make them stream, and a
 * redirect thrown from a page after its shell has been sent becomes a 200
 * with a client-side redirect instead of a 307. Guarding in the layout runs
 * before the loading boundary, so anyone else still gets the real redirect.
 * Each page keeps its own guard as well.
