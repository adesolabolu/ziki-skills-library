 * Connect my agent (#earn-connect): where the landing's button goes. The
 * person joins the Earn workspace (made the first time) and it becomes the one
 * they are working in on this device, so the agent they connect next is
 * created there and nowhere else. Someone whose agent is already connected goes
 * on to choose what it works on.
 *
 * The redirect is a path, not a URL built from the request: behind the proxy the request's own address is the
 * server's internal one (localhost), so an absolute redirect sent people there.
