 *
 *   Demo Work  (slug demo-work)  every kind of the Demo owner's work, nothing live yet
 *   Demo Live  (slug demo-live)  the same, and some live
 *
 * Each has the Demo owner as owner, one project, one set-up agent of theirs
 * that holds the claims, and a few issues in other states around them. Like
 * the Demo workspace they touch only their own rows (ids `fx-ws-*`) and a
 * rerun recreates them.
