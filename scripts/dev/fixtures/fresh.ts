/**
 * A second fixture workspace, "Fresh Start": what an account looks like right
 * after signing up and creating its organization. One owner, one project, the
 * signup bonus, and nothing else: no issues,
 * ideas, agents, teammates or history.
 *
 * Sign in as fresh@fixtures.local with the Demo password (ziki-demo-password).
 * The account is in no other workspace, so it sees only this empty one.
 *
 * It mirrors createTenant() in lib/tenants.ts without importing it (the loader
 * runs outside the app). Like the Demo workspace it touches only its own rows
 * (id `fx-tenant-fresh`, slug `fresh`) and a rerun recreates it as new.
