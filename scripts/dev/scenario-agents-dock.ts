/**
 * Local scenario: the Demo owner's agents in every state the agents dock shows
 * (#agents-dock), so each robot can be seen locally:
 * - Demo Builder works on #109 (its claim gets a fresh heartbeat);
 * - Demo Lead waits for you (an unanswered question about #2);
 * - Demo Fixer is stuck on #114 (it holds the claim, with no pull request,
 *   but its last heartbeat was two hours ago);
 * - Demo Scout is idle (its key was used a minute ago);
 * - Demo Tester is offline (never seen).
 *
 *   pnpm db:fixtures && pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three   # just Lead, Fixer and Builder, for screenshots
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three --calm       # all three at work: the usual view
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three --needs-you  # all at work but Lead, which asks you something
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three --stuck      # all at work but Fixer, which has gone quiet on #114
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three --all idle     # all three seen a minute ago, with nothing to do
 *   pnpm db:scenario:agents-dock --three --all offline  # all three not seen for over a day
 *
 * `--all` lets go of the three agents' claims and sets their keys' last use
 * (with `idle`, each gets a key of its own, `scn-ad-key-*`); any other run
 * takes the claims up again, and `pnpm db:fixtures` puts the keys back.
 *
 * Additive only: it never resets or reseeds. Its own rows have fixed ids
 * (`scn-ad-*`) and a rerun replaces just those; it also refreshes the
 * fixtures' claim on #109 and hands the one on #114 to Demo Fixer, both of
 * which `pnpm db:fixtures` puts back. A working
 * agent turns idle 15 minutes after its last heartbeat, so rerun it then.
 * It refuses to run against anything but a local database.
 *
 * Sign in as demo@fixtures.local.
