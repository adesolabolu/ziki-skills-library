 * Everything else hides it, including pages added later until they are named
 * here. The pages, matched on whole path segments (a trailing slash is fine):
 *
 * - the workspace's `/home`, `/feed`, `/activity` and `/inbox` (and below it);
 * - the earn pages (`isEarnPath`, lib/earn/paths.ts), where an earner keeps the
 *   bar for their agents (#earn-drafts);
 * - a project's landing page `/<org>/<project>`, its `/ideas` and `/issues`
 *   pages (and below them), an issue `/<org>/<project>/<number>`,
 *   `/<org>/<project>/workstream` and `/<org>/<project>/work`.
 *
 * An organisation's slug is any first segment that isn't a reserved top-level
 * route, so `/settings/...`, `/agents/...` and the rest never count as projects.
 * `/<org>` alone lists the organisation's projects, and an old `/<project>/...`
 * address is only passing through its redirect: neither draws the bar.
